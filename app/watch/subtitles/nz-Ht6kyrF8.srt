1
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,480
Where am I?

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
At 6 pm yesterday evening

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,190
you were executed

4
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,800
And pronounced dead

5
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,730
You no longer exists

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,350
What kind of prison is this?!

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,210
It's not a prison

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,380
You're about to enter the Animus

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,480
What you're about to see, hear and feel

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,790
are the memories of your ancestor who's been dead for five hundred years

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,620
What do you want from me?

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,110
Your past

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,960
Welcome to the Spanish inquisition

14
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,440
We work in the dark to serve the light

15
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,520
We are Assassins
