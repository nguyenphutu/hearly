1
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,780
The enemy tanks have stopped

2
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,580
Why ?

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,930
Why waste precious tanks when they can pick us off from the air like fish in a barrel?

4
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,560
There are 400,000 men on this beach

5
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,500
It's coming back round

6
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,440
It's coming back round!

7
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,260
Where are we going?

8
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,260
Dunkirk.

9
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,270
I'm not going back

10
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,380
There's no hiding from this, son

11
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,710
We have a job to do

12
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,320
If we go there, we'll die

13
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,960
You can practically see it from here

14
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,010
What?

15
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,080
