00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,440
How could you let

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,560
Baltazar Bratt

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,560

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,580
You're fired!

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,440
He is really good to snuggle with...

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,200
Agness what are you doing?

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,860
Since you don't have a job...I just wanted to help!

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,440
Excuse me...

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,300
Hey... could you....?

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,420
of course.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,160
..Now

12
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,580
As I was saying...

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,020
Goodbye!

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,440
Seriously?

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,380
I really must....

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,820
...have a word with you

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,820
on behalf of your twin brother

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,440
Dru

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,040
What?

20
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,100
Twin brother?

21
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,200
Twin brother?

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,140
I can't wait to meet my brother!

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,960
Brother!!

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,180
Who doesn't love this guy?

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,780
Look at him!

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,020
Oh! The hair will make you better

27
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,520
Look at his face!

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,380
Oh! He's so mad.

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,980
You must be his beautiful wife

30
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,160
Sweet daughter

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,600
This place is amazing.

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,480
It's mine I guess sure...

33
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,740
I'm not really into things.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,460
Face it, Gru!

35
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,960
Villain is in your blood!

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,820
You ready to continue the family tradition?

37
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,680
You and me?

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,060
No!

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,740
I left that life behind me.

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,560
Just one night !

41
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,520
I'm going in.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,460
I'm going to be impaled!

43
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,460
Haha, I'm Okay.

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,000
This does not mean that you're going back to be villains

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
Bueno?.....
