1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,040
What the hell is your delay, Captain?

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,180
We're waiting, sir

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,750
Waiting for what?!

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,510
Private Doss

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,400
Who the hell is private Doss?!

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,280
I always dreamed about being a doctor, but...

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,680
Didn't get much school

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,390
I can't stay here while all of them go fight for me

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,010
Would you figured this war is just going to fit-in with your ideas?

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,030
While everybody else is taking life, I'm gonna be saving it

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,640
That's gonna be my way to serve

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,450
This is a personal gift from the United States government

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,810
designed to bring death to the enemy

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,560
Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant, I can't touch a gun

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,130
You don't kill? - No, sir

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,830
You know, quite a bit of killing does occur in war?

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,380
Private Doss does not believe in violence

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,900
Do not look to him to save you on the battlefield

19
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,580
I don't think this is a question of religion. I think this is cowardice

20
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,970
I fell in love with you because you weren't like anyone else

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,390
They're saying you could go to prison

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,290
But I don't know how I'm gonna live with myself if I don't stay true to what I believe

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,940
With the world so set on tearing itself apart

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,810
don't seem like such a bad thing to me to want to put a little bit of it back together

25
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:25,280
Private Doss, you are free to run into the hellfire of battle without a single weapon to protect yourself

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,470
I'm gonna get you home!

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,180
There's something you gotta see

28
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,730
Who did this?

29
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,480
"Doss, the coward."

30
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,570
We have to go back up tomorrow

31
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,530
The men aren't gonna go up there without you

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,900
Help me - You'll have to trust me

33
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,790
You better come home to me

34
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,700
Please, Lord

35
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,250
help me get one more

36
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,200
Help me get one more
