1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,020
Come on, bud

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,680
There's a whole other world of dragons out there

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,600
Unbelievable

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,490
What do you say?

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,010
What should we name it?

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,600
Itchy armpit it is

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,840
I bet you think you know a lot about dragons

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,890
Should I know you? - No...

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,620
But a mother never forgets

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,560
Every dragon has its secrets

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,270
I'll show them all to you!

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,680
Did you know about this?

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,390
That's your mother?!

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,340
Now you know where I get my dramatic flair!

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,310
He likes you.

16
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,100
Something is coming. Something you've never faced before

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,360
What's down there?

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,540
I alone control the dragons!

19
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,900
Drago Bludvist is a madman

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,040
I'll bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon!

21
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,390
Dad, there's something you need to know

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,190
Oh, boy

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,280
I know what you're gonna say

24
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,290
You're as beautiful as the day I lost you

25
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,770
We're a team now

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,050
Now what do you want to do?

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,200
Drago's coming for our dragons

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,840
We have to stop him. Together

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,100
Don't worry, bud

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,290
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you

31
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,640
You have the heart of a chief...

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,670
That's my boy!

33
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,990
... and the soul of a dragon

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,560
You know that doesn't wash out

35
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,470
Cut them down!

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,630
Dragon riders coming through!

37
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,030
Heads up!

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,250
We can't fly these things!

39
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,500
They're babies!

40
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,260
They don't listen to anyone

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,130
Take 'em down, babe!

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,930
Come on, bud!

43
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,550
Hold on!

44
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,270
Distract the alpha!

45
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,550
Have a nice flight!

46
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,040
Yeah, baby!
