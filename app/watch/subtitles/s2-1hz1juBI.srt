1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,620
What the hell is your delay, Captain?

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,860
We're waiting, sir.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,540
Waiting for what?

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,180
Pvt. Doss.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,420
Who the hell is Pvt. Doss?

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,660
I always dream of being a doctor... But, uh...

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,600
didn't get much school.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,120
I can't stay here while all them go fight for me.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Would you figure this war is going to fit in with your ideas?

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,100
While everybody else is taking life, I'm gonna be saving it.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,220
That's gonna be my way to serve.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,360
This is a personal gift from the United States government

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,520
designed to bring death to the enemy.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,440
Well, I'm sorry, Sargeant. I can't touch a gun.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,260
You don't kill?

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,060
No, sir.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,980
You know quite a bit of killing does occur in war.

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,680
Pvt. Doss does not believe in violence.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,620
Do not look to him to save you on the battlefield.

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,480
I don't think this is a question of religion.

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,340
I think this is cowardice.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,420
I fell in love with you, because you weren't like anyone else.

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,140
They're saying you could go to prison.

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,260
I don't know how I'm going to live with myself if I don't stay true to what I believe.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,740
With the world so set on tearing itself apart ...

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,460
... don't seem like such a bad thing to me to want to put a little a bit of it back together.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,700
Pvt. Doss, you're free to run into the hellfire of battle without a single weapon to protect yourself.

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,880
I'm gonna get you home!

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,400
There's something you gotta see!

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,640
Who did this?

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,200
Doss the coward.

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,620
We'll have to go back up tomorrow.

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,620
And then I'm gonna go up there without you.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,340
Help me.

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,180
You'll have to trust me.

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,280
You better come home to me.

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,420
Please, Lord.

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,580
Help me get one more.

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,980
Help me get one more.
