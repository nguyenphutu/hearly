1
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,640
they're still on us

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,000
these guys are taking it personal

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,120
you were only supposed to create a diversion Roman

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,700
That was complete destruction!

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,940
what you want from me

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,820
I'm Roman Pearce, man! - It's what I do

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,000
phase two

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,540
phase two what's phase two?

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,780
bombs away

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,060
holy shh...

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,860
You know what i like about you Dom?

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,440
You're a genuine outlaw

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,560
But your family...

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,040
A hell of a job, brother!

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,620
We get back to the base, beer's on me!

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,380
...is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,140
You.

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,800
Did you ever think you'll even betray your family the way you did today?

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,440
Dominic Toretto

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,000
... just turned on us!

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,080
Well well well, would you look at that.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,140
I don't know why he's doing this, but that wasn't Dom.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,240
She's the very definition of "high-tech terrorism".

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,540
And now, she's working with your guy.

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,960
I think I found my team!

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,420
This should be interesting.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,900
You wanna play like that?

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,380
Ouch

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,980
This is impossible..

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,380
Which is why, we're going to need a little help.

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,860
I will beat you like a Cherokee drum!

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, took longer than I expected.

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,800
If you gotta catch Dom, you guys are gonna work together.

34
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,780
Surprise!

35
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,720
I just found love!

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,980
Hell, I've been waiting for this. We got a tank.

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,100
Let's roll.

38
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,280
Here they come.

39
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,220
I don't know if the old Dom is in there, but I don't give a damn. I am taking you down, Toretto.

40
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,540
Let's play.

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,220
Why are they shooting at me?

42
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,200
I don't know! Maybe cause you're in an Orange Lamborghini?

43
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,540
Shup up, Tej!

44
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,780
Oh shit!

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:59,600
We're gonna need a bigger truck!

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,440
Dom!

47
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,920
You're gonna turn your back on family?
