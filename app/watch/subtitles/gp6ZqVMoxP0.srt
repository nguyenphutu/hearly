1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,360
I'm not gonna dress it up

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,830
Turkeys are dumb

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,850
Really dumb

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,710
You don't get it! They're fatting us up to eat us!

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,870
Hey! Corn!

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,990
See you later, Reggie

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,780
From the academy award winning producer of Shrek

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,500
We came to this farm for my favorite presidential tradition

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,720
Pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,630
And the director of "Horton Hears A Who!"

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,900
Don't worry, you're safe

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,980
I'm tired now

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,030
This is your new home!

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,260
Pizza!

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,810
Does it get any better than this?

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,010
Hello, soldier

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,650
Whatever you do?

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,020
do not make a sound

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,720
You've been recruited for a top secret mission

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,150
What are you talking about?

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,370
We're going back in time to the first Thanksgiving

22
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,830
to get turkeys off the menu!

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,270
Who is talking to?

24
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,890
This guy, right here

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,190
He totally gets it

26
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,510
Look. See how he's nodding?

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,100
A map!

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,570
They aren't gonna just write "Time machine" on the...

29
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,060
Of course, they are

30
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,450
Control, we have a contaminant - Copy that. What type of agent?

31
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,950
Turkey, sir. How do we address it?

32
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,630
With cranberry sauce!

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,440
But seriously?

34
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:29,940
Let's go!

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,350
Wait, wait, wait!

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,080
Take us to the first Thanksgiving

37
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,790
Our mission is not to save ten turkeys...

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,150
Welcome to our home... but all of them

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,020
She wants you to throw up some worms into her mouth

40
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,600
What?

41
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,390
I will get those birds

42
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,060
Every last one of them!

43
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,870
Enemy approaching.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,280
You must follow me blindly!

45
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,670
For the flock!

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,480
What's your plan for getting in?

47
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,330
I'll use my incredibly toned pecks and buttocks to throw you over the wall

48
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,610
Go!

49
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,110
Funny, right?

50
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm sick of you throwing me around. You see this line?

51
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,550
Do not come into my personal space!

52
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,700
Did you not see the line? Cuz I was pretty clear....
