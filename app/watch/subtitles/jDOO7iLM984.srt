1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,850
Dad, this is my boyfriend, Martin

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,340
Pleasure to meet you Mr. Gallo

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,620
Nice to meet you, Martin

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,960
Martin is a musician.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,160
The, uh, banjo

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,690
Like Kermit the Frog?

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,940
Mr. Gallo?

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,030
Is Jenny home?

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:32,960
We broke up

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,820
Any idea where I could find her?

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,570
I don't have an address

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,530
but I've been over there.

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,410
You want to get dressed and you can take me over there?

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,520
You know where we're going, You drive

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,630
Actually, I don't drive

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,130
We love Jenny

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,100
but some of us loved her a little too much

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,720
What?

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,400
A certain someone in this house

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,940
wanted to have sex with your daughter

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,390
OK, we should get going.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,970
Hey, can I come?

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,600
You don't think she got kidnapped, do you?

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,690
So what is it that you do exactly?

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,430
We used to joke that you were an arms dealer

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,570
I'm in procurement

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,250
Look out!

28
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,550
So amazing when I was like

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,020
look out!

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,970
You're a real life saver

31
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,710
She'll turn up Mr. Gallo

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,890
You can call me Frank

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,020
I don't think I can do that.

34
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,310
This is a very bad idea

35
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,210
I need to see if my daughter is in trouble

36
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,460
Run

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,360
We've been searching for Jenny

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,250
all day and night

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,990
running from the police

40
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,950
I really don't need a recap, OK?

41
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,600
I was there

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,810
This happens every day

43
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,660
It's like that movie, John Wayne

44
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,630
This is not a movie, This is life

45
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,650
Nice work, guys

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Would you mind just putting something out there

47
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,660
I already did it

48
00:01:59,290 --> 00:01:59,840
You did what?

49
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,320
Tweeted it

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,740
"Baller old guy"

51
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,650
"Creepy young guy"

52
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,830
hashtag Random, hashtag Doable
