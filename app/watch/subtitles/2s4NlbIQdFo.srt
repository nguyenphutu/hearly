00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,460
Hello!

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,500
You know you gotta pay for that, right?

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,820
Come on!

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,000
Not OK!

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,780
We got ourselves an X-Men fan.

6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,600
Maybe a quarter of it happened...

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,000
And not like this.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,780
In the real world people die.

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,280
I don't wanna talk about it.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,560
Just stop!

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,620
Be careful.

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,980
I need the girl.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,060
What girl?

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,140
Go get her.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,000
No.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,220
No!

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,740
No!

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,320
Holy fuck...

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,940
She's like you.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,040
Very much like you.

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,960
I am not... whatever it is you think I am.

22
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,100
She needs our help.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,300
Someone will come along.

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,320
Someone has come along.

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,140
This is what life looks like.

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,220
People who love each other.

27
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,640
A home.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,660
You should take a moment

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,720
Feel it.

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,080
You still have time.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,660
Two days on the road, only one meal, and hardly any sleep.

32
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,660
She's eleven, I'm fucking 90.
