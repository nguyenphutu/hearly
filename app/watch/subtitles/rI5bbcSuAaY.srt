9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,440

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,910
on march 31st my movie DreamWorks The Boss Baby will be coming out!

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,380
we don't have any talking candle sticks, but if that's the deal breaker we'll cram one in there somewhere!

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,000
OH YEAH!

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,730

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,710

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,230

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,450

17
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,130

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,980

20
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,730
That's nice!

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm on a mission

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,290
puppies are woman and babies are losing!

23
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,850
My job is to find out why!

24
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,040
Now I'll see if there's a place round here with decent sushi!

25
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,825
I'd kill for a spicy tuna roll right about now

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,960
I will help you just to get rid of you!

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,240
How do we get past the guard?

28
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:06,386
ARF!

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,226

33
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:18,120

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,866

I can't reach the doorknob

42
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,186
I've never been so humiliated in all my lifffffe!

43
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,933
PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN

44
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:50,266
COOKIES ARE FOR CLOSURES!

45
00:43:43,457 --> 00:00:20,854

46
00:55:18,318 --> 00:01:05,065
