1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,120
Our team is the elite of the elite.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,240
We're the heart and soul of this very beach.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,940
We protect when other people don't wanna protect.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,980
And we go above and beyond.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,560
Help me! Help!

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,080
If you want me, you can have me

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,280
Some other time.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,580
We're starring into the abyss here.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
City council has already cut our funding.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,960
It's up to us to restore the Baywatch brand.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,980
I'm Mat Broody.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,800
Ready for duty.

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,540
You just ah... looked at my boobs?

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,040
I...

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,240
You should look to my face!

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,020
I'm trying...

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,280
But it's so close to your boobs.

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,540
This is the guy you think it's a good PR opportunity for us?

19
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,860
Do some shots!

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,660
He's reckless!

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,340
With two gold medals!

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,040
How many gold medals do you have?.. Probably zero!

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,340
We got a dead body on our beach.

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,690
That's not our job.

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,960
My gut says there's a bad shit going on over there

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,660
and my balls say we need to check it out.

27
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,820
My balls say it's just take it easy right here.

28
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,020
Why do your balls sound like three year old girl's?

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,700
I don't know, man. That's just how they talk. but they're wise!

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,920
Welcome to Baywatch.

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,240
Why are you grabbing me so tight?

32
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,270
Why does she always look like she is running in slow-mo?

33
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,030
You see it, too?

34
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,620
You turn the canals into the damn x-games.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,440
Yeah, that's cuz we were in lifeguard pursuits.

36
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,780
There's no such thing as lifeguard pursuit.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,720
How do I explain this so that you people understand.

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,460
You people? You people?!!

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,100
Oh, you don't get to say that. You're just tan.

40
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,640
Right on

41
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,100
Come on, brother.
