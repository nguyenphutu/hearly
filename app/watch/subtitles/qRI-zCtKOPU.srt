1
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:07,428
You all sacrificed so much to be here

2
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:09,600
and be a part of this thing we're doing

3
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:14,342
This crew is made up of couples

4
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:19,428
Its the first ever large scale colonization mission

5
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:22,400
everyone back on Earth is really grateful

6
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:24,400
for all your hard work

7
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:28,514
and your courage

8
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:31,171
We're making history here

9
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:35,714
It's sweet

10
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:39,571
What are the odds of finding human vegetation this far from Earth?

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,914
Who planted it?

12
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:47,657
You hear that?

13
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:48,542
What?

14
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:50,542
Nothing.

15
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:52,342
No birds...

16
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:54,371
no animals...

17
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:56,600
nothing.

18
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:11,885
What happened here?

19
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:31,514
Come in, do you read me?

20
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,257
What's happening?

21
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:41,485
I need you (gasp) right now

22
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,485
I need you...

23
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,028
...just calm down here, calm down.

24
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:44,457
Don't tell me to calm down!
...just calm down here, calm down.

25
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:45,771
Don't tell me to calm down!

26
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:45,828
You're breaking up
Don't tell me to calm down!

27
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:46,942
You're breaking up

28
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:53,228
All of this

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,457
to start our new life

30
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:06,142
Where is it?

31
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,628
Let me out!

32
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:13,685
Hold on!

33
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:19,771
Holy...
