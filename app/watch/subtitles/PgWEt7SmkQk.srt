1
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,120
Papa?

2
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,480
Belle, you must leave here

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,620
This castle is alive.

4
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:38,880
Who's there?

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,780
Do you wish to take your father's place?

6
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,090
Come into the light.

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,660
Show me the girl.

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,480
Look at her!.. What if she is the one?

9
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,980
The one who'd break the spell!

10
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,740
Hello!

11
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,600
You can talk?!

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,520
Belle, of course he can talk!

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,720
Hello, please to meet you!

14
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,780
The master's not as terrible as he appears.

15
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,580
I say we kill the beast!

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,600
Think of the one thing you've always wanted.

17
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,600
Now find it in your mind's eye... and feel it in your heart.

18
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,660
No!

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,280
Don't be afraid.

20
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,100
I'm not afraid.
