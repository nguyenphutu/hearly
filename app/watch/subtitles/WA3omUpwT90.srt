1
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,390
So, you're just starting your day, or did you just get off?

2
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,080
They call, I go, you know?

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,540
So, what is it you do?

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,150
I'm a driver.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,880
oh, Like a chauffeur

6
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,200
Anyone I'd know?

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,420
I hope not

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,720
What is your name?

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,740
Baby.

10
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,950
Your name's baby ?

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,710
B, A, B, Y, baby?

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,110
It's the one who listen to the music all the time

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,410
Is he mental?

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,950
Mental meaning slow, was he slow?

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,300
No.

16
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,140
He had an accident when he was a kid.

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,320
Still has a hum in the drum,

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,680
plays music to drown it out

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,060
and that's what makes him the best.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,070
One more job and I'm done.

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,080
One more job and we're straight.

22
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,030
I don't think i need to give you the speech about what'll happen when you say no,

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,080
how I could break your legs and kill everyone you love,

24
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,640
because you're and know that. Don't you?

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,410
yeah

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,440
The moment you catch feelings

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,700
is the moment you catch a bullet

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,450
And your waitress girlfriend, she's cute.

29
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,620
Let's keep it that way.

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,010
I want us to head west and never stop.

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:35,970
You in?

32
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,220
I'm in, Baby.

33
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,110
These days, Baby,

34
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,810
you've got to get blood on your hands

35
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,010
Time to face the music.

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,700
Baby, we need to get out of here

37
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,640
I have to end this.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,020
We're in bed together now.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,280
Baby. Baby. Baby

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,740
Doc said Micheal Myers!

41
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,140
This is Mike Myers

42
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,520
It should be the Halloween mask!

43
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,820
This is a Halloween mask!

44
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,710
No, the killer dude from Halloween!

45
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,130
Oh, you mean Jason.

46
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,000
No!

47
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,820
Baby, you tell me who dies.

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,820
She a good girl. You love her?

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,670
Yes, I do

50
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,770
that's too bad.
