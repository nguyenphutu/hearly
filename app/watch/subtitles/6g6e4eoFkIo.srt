1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,680
I missed you

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,130
OK

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,640
Challenge is strip to our underwear, get in the snow

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,770
First one to get up walks around the block

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,850
naked - Let's do it

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Go!

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,520
That is so cold!

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,800
You win, all right? Let's go

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,860
Jules?

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,670
Baby, come on Jules!

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,540
I'm sorry, but a kidney transplant

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,360
is the only solution

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,410
You're all I've got

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,960
It's nearly $200,000

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,030
I could go back to what I was doing

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,030
I don't you do that for me

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,960
All I'm trying to do is protect you

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,300
You have come back. I knew it

19
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,440
You look tense

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,520
Truck carrying golf balls packed with drugs

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,270
You steal truck. You bring it to me

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,900
Then you make your money

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,720
Is it dangerous? - What kind of question's that?

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,290
I wonder

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,610
who this foolish man could possibly be

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,620
I misjudged you, my friend

27
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,350
I believe I have something you want

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,520
Casey!

29
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,650
Leave her out of this

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,810
Some people tried to steal from me

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,390
and innocent characters died violent to meaningless deaths

32
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,050
Poor Juliette

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,070
I'm coming to gets you, Juliette

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,370
Run little piggy, run, run, run.

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,770
Hey, stay cool, man

36
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,590
All this trouble, all this pain, for love
