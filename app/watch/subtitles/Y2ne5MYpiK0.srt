00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,530
Summer in the city of Arendelle

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,020
It couldn’t be warmer

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,610
it couldn’t be sunnier

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,480
But that’s about to change…

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,950
Forever

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,450
Arendelle! - It's completely frozen!

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,990
Cold, cold, cold...

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,710
A real howler in July, ja?

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,160
The land is covered in eternal snow

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,600
Really?

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,310
If we don't do something soon, we will all freeze to death

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,870
You want to talk about a problem? I sell ice for a living

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,810
That's a rough business to be in right now

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,540
I mean, that is really...

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,610
That's unfortunate

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,270
My lady?

17
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,720
This is awkward. Not that you're awkard. But just because we're, I'm awkard

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,340
You're gorgeous. Wait, what?

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,000
Hi everyone, I'm Olaf

20
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,530
Hi! - You're creepy

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,490
I don't want it. No!

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,060
We got off to a bad start

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,820
I know how to stop this winter

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,800
Hang on! - I like fast!

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,850
Wow, wow, wow, wow! Get you feet down

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,450
This is fresh lacquer. Seriously where you raised in a barn?

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,740
Let's go bring back summer!

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,620
Man, am I out of shape...

29
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,200
Wolves! - Duck!

30
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,910
Are you okay? - I've got a thick skull

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,130
I don't have a skull

32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,230
Head rush!

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,680
It's so cute! - It's like being a baby unicorn

34
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,970
Now we just have to survive this blizzard!

35
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,070
That's no blizzard

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,980
That's my sister

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,870
That would have been nice to know

38
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,990
Heads up!

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,460
It is not

40
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,190
nice to throw snow people

41
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,590
Wow, wow, wow, feisty-pants, just let the snowman be!

42
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,900
'm calm. Great!

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,200
Oh, come on!

44
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,270
Olaf, you're melting!

45
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,270
Some people are worth melting for

46
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,510
Just maybe not right this second

47
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,110
Come on, buddy, faster! - No!

48
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,280
Olaf!

49
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,370
Hang in there guys!

50
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,910
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!

51
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,520
Those are my legs!

52
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,270
Hey, do me a favor. Grab my butt!

53
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,470
Oh, that feels better
