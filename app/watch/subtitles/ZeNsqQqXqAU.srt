00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,260
Two options:

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,260
You either follow my rules or follow my rules, capiche?
- Thank you.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,880
I could do it a different way.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,400
That's fine. Thank you very much.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,800
You're fired.

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,740
It's Christmas.

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,140
Yeah, I see the decorations

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,360
Good luck in the new year.

9
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,500
I just heard you play and I wanna ...

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,360
It's pretty strange that we keep running into each other.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,460
Maybe it means something.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,080
I doubt it

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,720
Yeah, I don't think so.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,560
You could just write your own roles, you know...

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,660
Write something that's as interesting as you are.

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,620
What are you gonna do?

17
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,020
Have my own club.

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,080
Is that gonna happen every time?

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,820
I think so.

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,380
How are you gonna be a revolutionary

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,240
If you're such a traditionalist?

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,520
You're holding onto the past...

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,220
but jazz is about the future.

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,380
Maybe I'm not good enough.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,960
Yes, you are!

26
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,640
Maybe I'm not.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,900
It's like a pipe dream.

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,020
This is the dream!

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,240
It's conflict and it's compromise!

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
It's very, very exciting.
