00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,650
This is a message from the Collective

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,340
Are you overly tired or experiencing increased sensitivity?

3
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,700
Remember, physical contact

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,510
or displays of feeling are a danger to all of us

5
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,460
Let's do our part to help contain this disease

6
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,910
Did any body see that? - Anyone recognize her?

7
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,030
That's our first jumper in a while

8
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,760
I've been watching you, the way you look at the world

9
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,930
The way you experience things

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,540
it's has to stop

11
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,140
If it continues, I'll be forced to report you

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,360
I can't stay away from you. I can't not be around you

13
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,510
realize what would happen if anyone saw us

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,590
can't happen. You know that

15
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,990
Do not risk your job. Do not risk you life

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,830
I was told to keep an eye on you

17
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,960
Is there something you want to tell me?

18
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,120
He knows - What are we gonna do?

19
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,600
seriously considering this

20
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,390
If we stay here, we'll be found out

21
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,580
If you make this decision, there's no turning back

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,930
Just remember what this feels like
