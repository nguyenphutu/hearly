1
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,860
It's going down

2
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,440
What?

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,060
It's sort of weird, being honored for the worst day of your life

4
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,680
You know things most of the rest of us will never know

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,760
That's gotta weigh heavy on a young man's shoulders

6
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,040
It's really good to have you back, little brother

7
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,500
Your story, Billy, no longer belongs to you

8
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,310
It's America's story now

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,620
So here you are, Billy

10
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,460
For the first time in my life

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,560
I feel close to something

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,650
bigger than myself

13
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,130
You just open the door, a crack of light comes pouring in

14
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,200
What really happened over there?
