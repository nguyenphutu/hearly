1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,700
How would you describe what The Circle is.. to.. say your grandmother?

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,840
It's the chaos of the web made...elegant

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,460
Speed Round Paul or John?

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,300
Early Paul, late John.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,420
Mario or Sonic?

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,220
Early Sonic, late Mario.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,700
Needs of the society, or needs of the individual?

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,600
Should be the same.

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,720
You're most scared of....?

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,160
Unfulfilled potential.

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,740
I am a believer in the perfectibility..of human beings.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,200
When we are our best selves

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,380
The possibilities are endless.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,760
At The Circle, there isn't a problem that we cannot solve

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,760
We can cure any disease and we can end hunger

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,260
Without secrets, without the hoarding of knowledge and information

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,800
We can finally realize our potential.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,580
Circlers, do you like to share?

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,060
Sharing is Caring!

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,920
We...will see it all!

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,680
If it happens, we all know!

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,820
Imagine the human rights implications.

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,580
There needs to be accountability.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,460
What is this?

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,940
The Circle has the power to change everything.

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,420
So many of our lies will get us in trouble.

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,960
Things we hide.

28
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,620
We care about everybody you care about.

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,080
Because knowing is good!

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,120
But knowing everything...

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,940
is better!
