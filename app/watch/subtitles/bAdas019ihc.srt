1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,240
Please don't make me go.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,900
You can keep homeschooling me.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,960
I taught you everything I know.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,380
No more argument, okay? We
discussed this ad nauseam.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,500
What's ad nauseam?

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,100
You don't know? Well, looks like someone needs school.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,120
Good morning, Miss Stevenson.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,560
Who can tell me what three plus three is?

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,480
Everyone knows it's six.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,680
Mary, can you stand up, please?

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,560
Can you tell me what 57 multiplied by 135 is?

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,400
Okay. Who can-- - 7695.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,740
The square root is 87.7 and change.

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,420
Now what does ad nauseam mean?

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,120
♫ I listen to the wind, to the wind of my soul

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,820
I think your niece may be gifted.

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,740
I am good friends with the headmaster of the Oaks Academy for Gifted Education.

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,660
No. I promised my sister...I'd give Mary a normal life.

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,060
I think she's gotta be here.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,960
♫ I've sat upon the setting sun

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,860
Who's that lady in front of our door?

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,140
That would be your grandmother.

23
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,340
Holy sh...

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,740
It's a MacBook, darling.

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,820
What are you doing here?

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,680
You are denying the girl, her potential.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,960
How many seven year olds are doing advanced calculus?

28
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,020
You forgot the negative sign on the exponent.

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,500
Mary, why didn't you say anything?

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,960
Frank says I'm not supposed to correct older people.

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,660
Nobody likes a smart-ass.

32
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,840
We petition the court to grant my client full custody of the child.

33
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,580
No!.. No!

34
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,720
You're gonna take that girl.

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,240
You're gonna loan her out to some think tank

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,060
Where she can talk nontrivial zeros with a bunch of old Russian guys for the rest of her life.

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,020
And you'd bury her under a rock.

38
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,820
Evelyn, stop!

39
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,440
I'm raising her how I believe Diane would have wanted.

40
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,680
♫ Do you need a reason ♫ We should commit treason

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,760
If anybody takes that baby away, I'll smother you in your sleep.

42
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,740
My sister wanted Mary to be a kid.

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,340
She wanted her to have friends and to be happy.

44
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,100
Tell us, do you have health insurance?

45
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,800
No.

46
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,820
Did you spend the night in jail? -- Objection!

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,580
What's your greatest fear?

48
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,020
That I'll ruin Mary's life.

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,900
Mary! -- Mary.

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,300
Mary! -- Uh-uh!

51
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,860
She's bossy.

52
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,080
I've heard that.

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,480
♫ Valleys of the young

54
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,860
He's a good person. He wanted me before I was smart.
