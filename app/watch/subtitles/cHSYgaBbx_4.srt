1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,457
This is our new orphanage

2
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:07,971
speakers of Carson

3
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,942
Feel free to use the house as you see fit

4
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:16,257
mrs. Mullins and I stay down here

5
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:19,057
your rooms are upstairs

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
locked

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,400
and it stays that way

8
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:35,228
hello

9
00:00:39,428 --> 00:00:40,971
the moon starter

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,914
aren't you

11
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:44,685
you help me

12
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:47,142
what do you need.

13
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:57,857
Jesus says she's seen your daughter

14
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:01,085
my daughter has been dead for a very long time

15
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:05,942
she was taken from us and early age

16
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:11,685
we prayed to see a beloved girl again

17
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,771
contact started small

18
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,171
but it wanted permission to move into old doll

19
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,428
so that it could be with us forever

20
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,857
we said yes

21
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:44,457
sister is coming after me

22
00:01:50,342 --> 00:01:52,371
who knew evil presence

23
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:56,257
it's because I'm let me guess

24
00:01:57,428 --> 00:01:58,514
it's the doll

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,600
the devil

26
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,857
