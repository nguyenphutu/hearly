1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,880
I can't believe it's been twenty years

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,420
still gonna take your father to the anniversary

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,230
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,910
On this day, in 1996

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,020
the world escaped the clutches of extinction

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,620
Your father was the bravest man I've ever seen

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,760
We all lost someone we love

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,290
But in their sacrifice we found the technology

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,850
to build a stronger and safer Earth

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,900
Because our survival

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,600
is only possible when we stand together

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,920
Oh, my God

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,180
A distress call

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,010
Why are they screaming? - They're not screaming

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,630
They're celebrating

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,210
They're coming back

17
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,860
It has its own gravity

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,340
What goes up, must come down

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,110
Shouldn't we be nervous?

20
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,710
Yeah!

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,070
Our whole lives built up to this moment

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,150
It's touched down over the Atlantic!

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,640
Which part? - All of it!

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,930
Make them pay

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,500
Not going up there to make friends

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,870
We've got to remind them Earth is not for the taking

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,680
I had years to get us ready

28
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,140
We're going down!

29
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,400
We never had a chance

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
We didn't last time either

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,810
We convinced an entire generation

32
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,650
that this is a battle that we could win

33
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,200
We sacrifice for each other, no matter what's the cost

34
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,750
And that's worth fighting for

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,750
It's the 4th of July

36
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,750
so let's show them some fireworks

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,870
Hold on!

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,700
They like to get the landmarks
