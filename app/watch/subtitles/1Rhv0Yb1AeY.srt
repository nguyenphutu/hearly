1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,120
How good to see you again so soon, Mister Wick.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,820
I need you to do this task.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,580
I'm not that guy anymore.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,400
You are always that guy, John.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,980
I can't help you.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,140
You know the rules.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,000
If you don't do this, you know the consequences.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,100
Accounts payable. How may I help you?

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,480
I'd like to open an account.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,620
Name of the account?

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,800
John Wick.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,660
The contract just gone international.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,640
You have no idea what's coming.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,860
Somebody please get this man...

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,800
... a gun!

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,520
You stabbed the devil in the back.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,760
To him, this isn't vengeance.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,260
This is justice.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,800
You're working?

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,740
Afraid so.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,120
Whoever comes

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,780
I'll kill them.

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,680
I'll kill them all!

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,080
Of course you will.

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,060
I'll try and do the same.
