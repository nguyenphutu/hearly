1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,790
Doctor Strange

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,070
You think you know how the world works?

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,350
What if I told you

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,300
the reality you know is one of many?

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,020
This doesn't make any sense

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,650
Not everything does

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,320
Not everything has to

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,770
Through the mystic arts, we harness energy

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,250
and shape reality

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,160
We travel great distances

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,410
in an instant

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,470
How do I get from here to there?

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,900
How did you become a doctor?

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,120
Study and practice, years of it

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,420
What the...

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,270
There's a strength to him - But is he ready?

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,670
Be careful which path you travel down, Strange

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,490
Stronger men than you have lost their way

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,170
I am death

20
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,320
and pain

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,870
You'll die protecting this world

22
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,820
I can't do this

23
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,420
There is no other way

24
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,120
I've spent so many years

25
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,810
hearing through time

26
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,070
looking for you

27
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,730
And what's this? My mantra?

28
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,760
The Wi-Fi password

29
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,790
We're not savages
