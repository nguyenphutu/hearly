1
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:13,056
I have been watching you

2
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:17,984
you have to remember.

3
00:00:20,352 --> 00:00:21,888
I saw someone down there

4
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:25,104
it wasn't human.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,800
He's a known terrorist

6
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:30,512
and he's killed again.

7
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,176
He didn't just kill them,

8
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:36,170
he hacked into their minds.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,904
He is everywhere and nowhere.

10
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:41,536
will find him.

11
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:45,264
and I gonna kill him.

12
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:58,624
You never talk about your past.

13
00:00:58,816 --> 00:00:59,936
I don't remember much,

14
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:00,048
just fragments.
I don't remember much,

15
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:00,928
just fragments.

16
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:04,064
There was an attack,

17
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:05,952
you were dying.

18
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:07,936
We saved you

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,400
and now you save others.

20
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:14,416
Everything they told you,

21
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:15,808
was a lie.

22
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,096
You had a family.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,288
Remember that.

24
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:26,336
What are you?

25
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:29,792
What a beauty you are.

26
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,360
What do you want from me?

27
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,616
They did not save your life,

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,464
they stole it.

29
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:50,048
How many more there before me?

30
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:54,480
She was supposed to have a clean brain.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,900
I ordered you to terminate.

32
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,150
They created me

33
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,150
but they cannot control me
