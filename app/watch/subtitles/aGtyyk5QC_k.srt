1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,840
There are days that define your story beyond your life

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,040
Like the day they arrived

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,700
What might be called "first contact".The objects measure at least...

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,680
I'm Colonel G.T. Weber from the intelligence. Pack your bags

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,780
You are at the top of everyone's list when it comes to translations

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,770
Priority one: what do the want, where are they from?

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,780
You'll be reporting to me, but you'll be working with him

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,920
when you're in the shell

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,920
That's what they're calling the UFO

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,710
Who's being carted off in the medevac?

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,040
Not everyone is wired for what you're about to do

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,020
So, what do they look like?

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,760
You'll see soon enough

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,830
Every 18 hours, a door opens up

15
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,860
That's where we go in

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,030
It's time

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,460
Yeah, that just happened

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,820
What happens now? - They arrive

19
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,110
They need to see me - Doctor Banks?

20
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,620
Are you insane?!

21
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,340
Now, that's a proper introduction

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,470
More objects have landed around the world

23
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,760
This is one of twelve

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,620
We never gonna be able to speak their words

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,720
You've got two days - Figure something out

26
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,670
I am human

27
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,440
It's their language!

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,270
We need to make sure that they understand

29
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,530
the difference between a weapon and a tool

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,900
language is messy and sometimes one can be both

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,800
Are you dreaming in their language?

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,490
Wake up, mommy

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,180
It's possible they're prodding us to fight among ourselves

34
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,440
This is just a way to force us to work together for once

35
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,490
It's more complicated than that

36
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,630
how is it more complicated

37
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,880
Russia just executed one of their own to keep their secret!

38
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,390
You got 21 hours before they start a global war

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,150
How do we clarify their intentions?

40
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,480
I go back in

41
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,500
Why does this feel worse?
