1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,080
Never going to get it...

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,500
Look at him

3
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,400
Does anything about that look normal to you?

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,730
Let's rack him

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,460
Here, heavy

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,130
Well, there's no coming back from that

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,950
My man! - Yo, you better back up, man!

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,480
Calvin! It's me, Bob

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,910
Sorry, do I know you? - Robbie Weirdick from high school

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,460
God, man, look at you. You lost like 200 pounds!

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,770
What'd you do? - I just did one thing

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,860
I need to know

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,800
I worked out six hours a day, every day, for the last 20 years straight

14
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,620
You should know one thing about me...

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm in the CIA - Are you joking with me right now?

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,730
Drop your weapon! Do it now! - I got a plan

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,170
It might get us both killed, but if it works it will be a totally boss story

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,960
Cool? - No. No, it's not cool

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,860
Cool - No, I said it's not cool

20
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,740
Three weeks ago an enemy of the state stole the encryption keys to the entire US spy satellite program

21
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,760
I need your super sweet accounting skills

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,800
to help me figure out the last piece of this puzzle

23
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,930
You're like a chocolate Google. Boop, boop, boop

24
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,870
Bob, don't do that. Stop it. Stop it

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,030
You were the coolest guy in school

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,400
You're my only friend, Calvin

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,560
You're the only one in this whole world that I trust

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,600
Now that you're in - I'm not in

29
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,740
I know. But they think you're in

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,440
But i'm not

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,090
Probably one of those perception versus reality things happening right now - No. I am out!

32
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,430
Which car are we taking?

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,170
Not that one - Oh my God

34
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,700
You chose to be an international CIA spy

35
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,840
Cuz I don't like bullies

36
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,960
You're like Jason Bourne in "jorts"

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,510
Did you see that pop?

38
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,710
I did the thing

39
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,930
I did the thing, Bob!

40
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,170
You remember those backflips you used to do?

41
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,300
Let's do the flip

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,640
That was so close
