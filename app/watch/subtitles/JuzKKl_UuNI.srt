00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,500
Today's the day!

2
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,420
Our field trip

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,490
to the stingray migration

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,350
Stingray migration

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,520
Migration is about going home

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,210
Home!- Which is where you're from

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,010
How do the stingrays all know where to go?

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,020
Instinct. Something deep inside you that feels so familiar that you have to listen to it

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,630
My mom, my dad!

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,950
I have a family!

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,660
We will never forget you, Dory

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,390
What if I forget you?

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,650
I miss them

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,790
Do you know what that feels like?

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,540
Yes

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,990
Then we better get going!

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,270
Totally sick!

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,770
Isn't it great?

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,130
No, I'm gonna be totally sick!

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,400
Can you help me?

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,720
Sorry, not a great swimmer

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,920
I think you swim beautifully!

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,010
Thank you!

24
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,430
You're welcome!

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,120
Wait, Dory?- Yes

26
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,980
Dory?- Yes.

27
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,820
You and I were friends!- No!

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,120
It was so much fun: I'd tell you a story and you'd completely forget about it!

29
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,280
And then I'd get to tell it to over and over again!

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,710
I'm looking for my family

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,370
Are you crazy?

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,330
It's too dangerous!

33
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,000
Hands!- Hands?

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,910
Mommy?

35
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,100
Holy Neptune!

36
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,040
That is definitely not Mommy!

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,180
I'm sorry- I gotta blink

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,810
How do you hold your eyes open that long?

39
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
Hand, what's happening?

40
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,050
Hello?

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,390
Hey, you!

42
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,280
Hi, can you help me?

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,030
Not good
