1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,220
What's up, guys?

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,760
So, to become an Avenger

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,880
are there like trials, or...an interview?

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,360
Do me a favor. Can't you just be a friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man?

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,240
Just... stay close to the ground.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,560
You're the Spider-Man! From YouTube!

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,980
Can you summon an army of spiders?

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,060
No, Ned. No...

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,560
Do you know him, too?

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,520
I stole his shield.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,660
Can I try the suit on?

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Badass.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,400
The rich and the powerful, like Stark

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,880
they don't care about us.

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,480
The world's changing, boys.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,040
It's time that we change, too.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,160
His weapons are crazy dangerous!

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,740
Listen, Peter, forget the flying monster guy.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,900
There are people who handle this sort of thing.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,980
Your legal weapon barrel was at 2:30.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,560
You missed it!

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,000
What if somebody died?

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,720
I was just trying to be like you.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,200
I wanted you to be better.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,140
I'm gonna need the suit back.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,440
But I'm nothing without this suit!

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,960
If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it.

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,520
I screwed up

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,620
You need to stop carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,420
I want you to understand

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,660
I'll do anything to protect my family.

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
I know you know what I'm talking about...

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,500
..so don't mess with me.

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,700
Cuz I will kill you

35
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,680
and everybody you love.

36
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,180
My friend's up there!

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,640
That guy is still out there.

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,620
I've just got to do this on my own.

39
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,540
Just... don't do anything stupid.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,160
I got this!

41
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,520
Alright?

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,360
Yeah
